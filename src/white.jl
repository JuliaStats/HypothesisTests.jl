    WhiteTest(X, e; type = :White)

Compute White's (or Breusch-Pagan's) test for heteroskedasticity.

`X` is a matrix of regressors and `e` is the vector of residuals from the original model.
The keyword argument `type` is either `:linear` for the Breusch-Pagan/Koenker test,
`:linear_and_squares` for White's test with linear and squared terms only (no cross-products), or
`:White` (the default) for the full White's test (linear, squared and cross-product terms).
`X` should include a constant and at least one more regressor, with observations in rows and
regressors in columns. In some applications, `X` is a subset of the regressors in
the original model, or just the fitted values. This saves degrees of freedom and may
give a more powerful test. The `lm` (Lagrange multiplier) test statistic is T*R2
where R2 is from the regression of `e^2` on the terms mentioned above.
Under the null hypothesis it is distributed as `Chisq(dof)` where `dof` is the number
of independent terms (not counting the constant), so the null is rejected when the
test statistic is large enough.
