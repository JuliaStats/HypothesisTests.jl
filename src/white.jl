    WhiteTest(X, e, TestType)

Compute White's (or Breusch-Pagan's) test for heteroskedasticity.

`X` is a matrix of regressors and `e` is the vector of residuals from the original model.
`TestType` is either `:Linear` for the Breusch-Pagan/Koenker test, `:LinearAndSquares` for
White's test with linear and squared terms only (no cross-products), or `:White` (the default)
for the full White's test (linear, squared and cross-product terms). `X` should include a
constant. In some applications, `X` is a subset of the regressors in the original model,
or just the fitted values. This saves degrees of freedom and may give a more powerful test.
The test statistic is T*R2 where R2 is from the regression of `e^2` on the terms
mentioned above. Under the null hypothesis it is distributed as `Chisquare(dof)`
where `dof` is the number of independent terms (not counting the constant), so the null
is rejected when the test statistic is large enough.
