    JarqueBeraTest(y::AbstractVector)

Compute the Jarque-Bera statistic to test the null hypothesis that a real-valued vector `y`
is normally distributed.

Note that the approximation by the Chi-squared distribution does not work well and the
speed of convergence is slow. In small samples, the test tends to be over-sized for
nominal levels up to about 3% and under-sized for larger nominal levels (Mantalos, 2010).
