    MannWhitneyUTest(x::AbstractVector{<:Real}, y::AbstractVector{<:Real})

Perform a Mann-Whitney U test of the null hypothesis that the probability that an
observation drawn from the same population as `x` is greater than an observation drawn
from the same population as `y` is equal to the probability that an observation drawn
from the same population as `y` is greater than an observation drawn from the same
population as `x` against the alternative hypothesis that these probabilities are not
equal.

The Mann-Whitney U test is sometimes known as the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

When there are no tied ranks and ≤50 samples, or tied ranks and ≤10 samples,
`MannWhitneyUTest` performs an exact Mann-Whitney U test. In all other cases,
`MannWhitneyUTest` performs an approximate Mann-Whitney U test. Behavior may be further
controlled by using [`ExactMannWhitneyUTest`](@ref) or [`ApproximateMannWhitneyUTest`](@ref)
directly.

Perform an exact Mann-Whitney U test of the null hypothesis that the probability that an
observation drawn from the same population as `x` is greater than an observation drawn

from the same population as `y` is greater than an observation drawn from the same

When there are no tied ranks, the exact p-value is computed using the `pwilcox` function
from the `Rmath` package. In the presence of tied ranks, a p-value is computed by exhaustive
enumeration of permutations, which can be very slow for even moderately sized data sets.

"""
    ApproximateMannWhitneyUTest(x::AbstractVector{<:Real}, y::AbstractVector{<:Real})

Perform an approximate Mann-Whitney U test of the null hypothesis that the probability that
an observation drawn from the same population as `x` is greater than an observation drawn
from the same population as `y` is equal to the probability that an observation drawn
from the same population as `y` is greater than an observation drawn from the same

The p-value is computed using a normal approximation to the distribution of the
Mann-Whitney U statistic:

        a & = \\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}} t^3 - t
