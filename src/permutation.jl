Perform a permutation test (a.k.a. randomization test) of the null hypothesis
that `f(data)` is ??? across all groups (typically more than 2 groups).  All
possible permutations are sampled.

The function `f` should reduce on the indices that comprise the groups in
the data using the statistics of interest.

# Examples
Say you want to test the difference in means between 3 groups (1,1), (2,2), 
and (9,9,9,9), you'll first need to concatenate your data into a vector.
Then you'll need to create a function that accumulatively subtracts the 
mean of the 1:2, 3:4, and 5:8 values of a given vector.
