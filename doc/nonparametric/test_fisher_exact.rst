Fisher exact test
=============================================

.. function:: FisherExactTest(a::Integer, b::Integer, c::Integer, d::Integer)

    Perform Fisher's exact test of the null hypothesis that the
    success probabilities ``a/c`` and ``b/d`` are equal, that is the odds ratio
    ``(a/c) / (b/d)`` is one, against the alternative hypothesis that they are
    not equal.

    The contingency table is structured as:

        .. list-table::
           :widths: 10 10 10
           :header-rows: 1
           :stub-columns: 1

           * -
             - X1
             - X1
           * - Y1
             - a
             - b
           * - Y2
             - c
             - d

    .. note::
        The print output contains the conditional maximum likelihood estimate of the odd-ratio
        rather than the sample odds ratio; it maximizes the likelihood given by Fisher's
        non-central hypergeometric distribution.
