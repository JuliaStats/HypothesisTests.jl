Confidence Interval
==============================================

.. function:: confint(test::HypothesisTest, alpha=0.05; tail=:both)

    Compute a confidence interval C with coverage 1-``alpha``.

    If ``tail`` is ``:both`` (default), then a two-sided confidence
    interval is returned. If ``tail`` is ``:left`` or
    ``:right``, then a one-sided confidence interval is returned

    .. note::
      Most of the implemented confidence intervals are *strongly consistent*, that is, the
      confidence interval with coverage 1-``alpha`` does not contain the test statistic
      under :math:`h_0` if and only if the corresponding test rejects the null hypothesis
      :math:`h_0: \theta=\theta_0`:

      .. math::
        C (x, 1 − \alpha) = \{\theta : p_\theta (x) > \alpha\},

      where :math:`p_\theta` is the :ref:`p-value<pvalue>` of the corresponding test.


.. _ci_binomial:

Confidence Interval for Binomial Proportions
----------------------------------------------

.. function:: confint(test::BinomialTest, alpha=0.05; tail=:both, method=:clopper_pearson)

   Compute a confidence interval with coverage 1-``alpha`` for a binomial proportion
   using one of the following methods. Possible values for ``method`` are:

   - Clopper-Pearson interval ``:clopper_pearson`` (default): This interval is based on the binomial
     distribution. The empirical coverage is never less than the nominal coverage of
     1-``alpha``; it is usually too conservative.
   - Wald interval ``:wald`` (normal approximation interval): This interval relies on
     the standard approximation of the actual binomial distribution by a normal distribution.
     Coverage can be erratically poor for success probabilities close to zero or one.
   - Wilson score interval ``:wilson``: This interval relies on a normal approximation.
     In contrast to ``:wald`` the standard deviation is not approximated by an empirical
     estimate resulting in good empirical coverages even for small numbers of draws and
     extreme success probabilities.
   - Jeffreys interval ``:jeffrey``: Bayesian confidence interval obtained by using a
     non-informative Jeffreys prior. The interval is very similar to the Wilson interval.
   - Agresti Coull interval ``:agresti_coull``: Simplified version of the Wilson interval;
     they are centered around the same value. The Agresti Coull interval has higher or
     equal coverage.

.. _ci_multinomial:

Confidence Interval for Multinomial Proportions
----------------------------------------------

.. function:: confint(test::PowerDivergenceTest, alpha=0.05; tail=:both, method=:sison_glaz)

   Compute a confidence interval with coverage 1-``alpha`` for multinomial proportions
   using one of the following methods. Possible values for ``method`` are:

   - Sison, Glaz intervals ``:sison_glaz`` (default):
   - Bootstrap intervals ``:bootstrap`` :
   - Quesenberry, Hurst intervals ``:quesenberry_hurst`` :
   - Gold intervals ``:gold`` (Asymptotic simultaneous intervals):

.. _ci_fisher:

Confidence Interval for Fisher exact test
----------------------------------------------

.. function:: confint(x::FisherExactTest, alpha::Float64=0.05; tail=:both, method=:central)

   Compute a confidence interval with coverage 1-``alpha`` by inverting the ``:central`` p-value.
